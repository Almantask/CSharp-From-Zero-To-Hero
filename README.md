# C#: From Zero To Hero
## Chapter 2: OOP. Homework 4: Interface

### Task
```
Part 1
When the program boots and shutdowns a log message needs to be written. 
There are two options: either log to a file or log to a console. 
If something goes wrong, it should also be logged. 
Implement logger to a file or to a console and use the same logger consistently throughout the application.

Part 2
Take homework 1And2 and instead of using console to do the logging, 
use your interface and the two implementation to handle it.
