  # The vision
"Programming is hard". Yes.But not harder than running a marathon for a person has never run. It's not harder than 
building a house if you never built one. Programming is hard only until you practice it (like any other skill). I would like to invite you to learn programming and C# following this course to practice programming and ignite passion for finding little miracles in code every day 🙂
  
  # Requirements
  Visual Studio Community 2019 or similar with Web Development and desktop development workloads.  

  Patience and persistence  
  Git installed  
  Github account  
  
  # Homework 
  Homework will be announced at the end of every lesson and placed in this repository base on lesson name. There will be 2 branches after every lesson:  
  ```
  Lesson/LessonName  
  Homework/LessonName  
  ```
  ## Git
  Fork this repository (Homework/LessonName). 
  The fork target is called upstream branch. For every chapter, you will need to keep updating upstream branch. 
  How to work with forked repository in Visual Studio Teams:

  ## How to complete homework? 
  ### Implementation of homework
  For the first chapters, homework branch will come with 2 projects:
  ```
  ChapterName.csproj
  ChapterName.Tests.csproj
  ```
  For now, a student should not care about about the tests project, as long as it builds. 
  All the student work will happen in **ChapterName.csproj**. 
  You will have empty functions which you will have to implement based on the homework requirements. 
  Student can consider a **homework complete if all tests pass**.
  
  ### Homework submission
 
  In order for mentors to review your homework, you will need to create a Pull Request (PR) 
  How to do it can be found here: (TODO: add link) 
  
  ## Homework review
  ### Automatic code reviewer
  ### Auto build and auto tests
  In order to find out if your code works not just on your machine but in all environments, check the build status. 
  In PR you will see Azure Pipelines and it should have x check passed.

  ### Mentor code review
  In order for your PR to be complete, it needs a code review of at least 2 mentors. 
  Both of the mentors will have to approve your code, otherwise you won't have a PR completed. 
  How to do code review:
  As a reviewer- Todo: link
  As a reviewee-Todo: link
  Code reviews on GitHub- Todo: link
  
  ### Finishing homework
  You can consider your homework complete if all of the above steps pass. 
  **Don't merge the PR to master branch**
  A single best homework implementation will be merged to master.
