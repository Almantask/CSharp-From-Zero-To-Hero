  - Correct! Now the real journey begins...
  - Well then. Here we go:
  - Let me check if your solution is correct...
  - Very well. You solved this.

## Hints

- There are no tests to pass in this homework.
- Make **sure** that you opened Bootcamp.sln!
- This homework's task is to give you a playful experience with the debug mode.
- This homework is very easy if you know what happens and what to do.
- You don't have to change the code at all.
- You are only supposed to set breakpoints and click the debug button.
- To prevent you from cheating we had to go for stuff that is out of your current scope.
  - To be exact this scope is not even present in the near future.
  - Do not try to understand how everything is exactly working out. We will explain this when you're ready for this!
- You are able to solve this by simply observing the console output. Nothing else is needed!

## Task

1. Open Program.cs.
2. Add one or more breakpoints to your code.

- Rightclick a line of code (`Console.WriteLine();` for example.
- Search for **Breakpoint** menu option.
- Click **Add Breakpoint** in the submenu.
- Look to the left. A red circle should have appeard.
- Remember this vertical bar of the circle!
- You can add or remove breakpoints by clicking this bar.
  - Try it! Click the red circle once. It will disappear.
  - Click again and the circle appears again.

3. Run code in debug mode.

- Click the green arrow in the upper screen (rather left) with "BootCamp.Chapter" on it.
- Now the program will run until it's first breakpoint.
- The line of the breakpoint will **not** execute until you press the green button "Continue" again. (Simplified)
  - This means that said `Console.WriteLine();` will not print a new line before you did click "Continue".
  - Remember this very well! Otherwise this will lead to confusion in later homeworks - most likely.
