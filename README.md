# C#: From Zero To Hero
## Chapter 3: C#. Homework 3: Null related operators and more sugar
### Intro
C# is a modern high-level programming language. It has many nice features and it's time to explore some of it.
In particular, it's really cool the way C# handles null. There are several operators/patterns in regards to null handling and typecheck.
There is:
- ?. - null-conditional operator
- ?? - null-coalecense operator
- ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse - conditional operator
- value is Type1 - pattern matching  

A lot of neat quality of programmer life improvements provided by a language design. It's time to try it out!

### Task
Take [homework 1 assignment](https://github.com/csinn/CSharp-From-Zero-To-Hero/tree/Chapter3/Homework/1/Src/BootCamp.Chapter)
and refactor it trying to apply the operators and functions learned in lesson- as much as you can.
If you haven't done homework 1, refer to [chapter 2 homework 3](https://github.com/csinn/CSharp-From-Zero-To-Hero/tree/Chapter2/Homework/2) what needs to be done.

Also apply null validation for every method and constructor:
1) Don't allow passing null references  
2) Don't allow passing null or empty strings

Note: the tests still are meant for getter/setter METHODS, so you will need to update them in case you didn't already.
